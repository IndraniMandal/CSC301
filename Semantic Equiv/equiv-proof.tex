\bs{Equivalence Proof}
{\bf Proposition:} In  language THREE
 the sentence $E + E$ is semantically
equivalent to $2 * E$ for any subexpression $E\in L(\mbox{THREE})$.

(Observe that $E + E \ne 2 *E$ because this is just syntax, that is,
the abstract syntax trees of these two expressions do not look the same, but we 
expect that semantically they express the  same thing.)

{\bf Proof:} From elementary algebra we know that given any integer value $i$ we
have $i + i = 2 \times i$.  We will use this identity in our proof.

Assume that $\langle E, C \rangle \rightarrow e$, that is, we assume that our 
subexpression $E$ evaluates to some integer value $e$ in the context of the
binding environment $C$. So,
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\langle {\tt var}(x), C \rangle \rightarrow \mathit{lookup}(x,C)=k$}
\AxiomC{$\langle {\tt var}(x), C \rangle \rightarrow \mathit{lookup}(x,C)=k$}
\BinaryInfC{$\langle {\tt plus}({\tt var}(x),{\tt var}(x)),C\rangle \rightarrow k + k = 2\times k$}
\end{prooftree}
which follows from our algebraic identity above. Now,
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\langle 2,C\rangle \rightarrow 2$}
\AxiomC{$\langle {\tt var}(x), C \rangle \rightarrow \mathit{lookup}(x,C)=k$}
\BinaryInfC{$\langle {\tt times}(2,{\tt var}(x)),C\rangle \rightarrow 2 \times k$}
\end{prooftree}
This concludes our proof. $\Box$
